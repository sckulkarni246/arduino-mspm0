# arduino-mspm0

This is an attempt to make an Arduino core for TI's MSPM0 series of microcontrollers.

As of now:

- Target device is MSPM0G3507
- Target board is LP-MSPM0G3507
- Only builds are supported (you need to use BSL separately to do an upload to the board - more instructions will follow)
